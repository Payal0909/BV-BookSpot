# BV-BookSpot 
*BV-BookSpot* is a web-based second-hand books trading application which facilitates students for buying and selling second-hand books under the categories like education and entertainment within our college campus.
 
A common problem faced by students in Banasthali Vidyapith is getting second hand books like course books,notes etc. for semesters or any other novels especially for those who are fond of reading, from other students and that too at a cheaper price. They have to find seniors who are willing to sell these products.

On the other hand , a similar problem is faced by the students who want to sell their products as they have to cover different hostels to make announcements which disturbs the entire hostel due to unavailability of a common platform to interact for the same. 

Hence, our website *BV-BookSpot* is here to bridge the gap between sellers and buyers bringing them to a one common platform fulfilling their needs and giving them a user friendly experience in this process of trading of books.
